# 10/13 **Estimation_of_harmonic_series**

Evaluate the biggest input $x$ and the biggest output $N$  that MATLAB can run for $$S_N = \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{n} >x$$ in ten minute

Tips: When $\frac{1}{n}<\text{ machine epsilon}$  it will add as zero, that is, the biggest $N$ is $\frac{1}{\text{ machine epsilon}}$
