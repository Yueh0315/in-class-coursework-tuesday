# 10/20 Exam 1: accurate_graph

Given a differentiable function $f(x)$ (take $xsin(x)$ as example) and interval $[-L, L]$, draw the graph with its critical points.

Use **Root_finding_violence.m** to find the roots of $f'(x)=0$, draw the graph of $f(x)$ and point the roots of $f'(x) = 0$

**Result:**
